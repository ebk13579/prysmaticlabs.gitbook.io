# Architecture Overview

## This documentation portal is depreciated and no longer maintained. Please visit [docs.prylabs.network](https://docs.prylabs.network) for the most recent iteration.

## Prysm client components

When a Prysm client is initialised out of the box, it starts a variety of services that run in parallel to handle everything required for the lifecycle of the beacon chain. In no particular order, Prysm includes:

* A ****[**beacon node**](the-beacon-chain.md) which powers the beacon chain at the core of Ethereum 2.0.
* A ****[**validator client**](validator-clients.md) connects to the beacon node and manages staking keypairs.
* A ****[**public RPC server**](ethereum-2.0-public-api.md) to request data about network state, blocks, validators etc.
* A [**persistent key-value store**](database-backend-boltdb.md) in the form of a database \([BoltDB](database-backend-boltdb.md)\).
* A ****[**P2P networking framework and server**](p2p-networking.md) to connect with other beacon nodes.
* **Monitoring and metrics gathering technologies:** [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/) and [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io) track everything. happening across beacon nodes in the network.

## Prysm client functionality

As described in [this section](../introduction/ethereum-2.0.md), Ethereum 2.0 encompasses a distributed network of blockchains called shard chains which are coordinated by a root chain, known as a beacon chain. This beacon chain serves as a mechanism to manage a set of [Proof-of-Stake](../glossaries/terminology.md#proof-of-stake-pos) [validators](../glossaries/terminology.md#validator) and overall consensus across shards. 

Shards themselves are similar to the current Ethereum 1.0 chain, which stores blocks containing user-generated transactions such as token transfers and smart contracts. Ethereum 2.0 provides a massive improvement over 1.0 by having 1024 of these shard chains, each with the capacity of the existing [ETH1](../glossaries/terminology.md#eth1) blockchain.

As shown above, the beacon chain runs through a distributed network of nodes known as [beacon nodes](the-beacon-chain.md). Participants who want to run a beacon node and help secure the network can stake 32 ETH to have their [validator client](validator-clients.md) join the overall pool of validators, whom have the responsibility of [proposing](../glossaries/terminology.md#propose) and [attesting](../glossaries/terminology.md#attest) to new blocks on the beacon chain. This deposit does not come out of nowhere however; validators transfer Ether from the [ETH1](../glossaries/terminology.md#eth1) chain to the 2.0 system through the use of a [validator deposit contract](validator-deposit-contract.md). 

Each of these components and their roles in the Prysm client are explained within the following sections of this documentation. If you have any questions, please stop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KSA7rPr).
